---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Machine Learning Challenge for 30 Days by doing a Hands-On Kaggle and upgrade your badge**


**This is all base on the Challenges and Excercise on the Kaggle**


**Kaggle is a plafrom where all over the Globe Data Scienctist and Machine Learning Experts meet together.**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Kaggle 
Kaggle contains the Datasets,Codes,Competition,Courses and Discussion sections.
#### 1. DataSets
   The Datasets is like a energy or food to the model of any machine learning, or data science project and kaggle containg more than 54k+ Public Datasets to work on them.
#### 2. Codes
   It not enough to just containg a datasets, these datasets are used by all around the World by more than One Million Active Users. These people work on the datasets.
#### 3. Competitions
   The globally hosted competition are taken here with a cash-prizes and also a prizes of swags and like more than thousands of teams are participate in the competitions. These competition are offered by every compnaies and orgaziations like( Google, Facebook , etc).
#### 4. Courses
   Kaggle offered so many courses related to the Machine Learning and Data Science. You can learn these skill by doing a excercises and learnt the theory of course.
#### 5. Discussion
   To disscus about your problems,projects,codes,dataset.This is all open discussion form that everyone is looking into it and participate.

In this Repo, I'll update all the days of my kaggle work with the Excercise and all the stuff I'll learn during this 30 Days Challenge.

## Overview of Challenge

In the first 2 weeks, you’ll receive hands-on assignments delivered to your inbox. The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data. You'll start by learning how to code in Python and quickly learn how to build your first machine learning model.

After tackling these core concepts, you’ll be invited to a super fun, beginner-friendly Kaggle machine learning competition to test your knowledge. Through practice, you’ll explore the best ways to use Kaggle as a learning resource and connect with other data scientists.

On top of all of this, you’ll have the opportunity to attend elective workshops and seminars hosted by data scientists from Google's Developer Experts Program. The challenge kicks off on August 2nd and only requires a Kaggle account.
